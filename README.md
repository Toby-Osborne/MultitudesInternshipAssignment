To run this CLI tool, you must have python 3 installed and added to you path environment.
If you are not sure, type "python" into your command line (terminal on mac/linux).  It should say "Python 3.x.x" followed by some version info.
If this is not the case, you will need to install python and add it to your path environment (windows) or shell path (mac os)

Once this is done, you will need to run the following command:
       
       pip install pygithub
       
Once this is done, navigate to the directory of cli.py in your terminal and run the command:
       
       python cli.py
       
This program takes no arguments, and you will instead be prompted to enter the username and repo that you are trying to access
Keep in mind that only 60 requests may be made per hour for most users.
